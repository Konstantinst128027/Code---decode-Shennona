I have created a Shannon encoder/decoder. First, it reads the text from "infile.txt " after the text has been encoded, I send the encoded text and dict to "outfile.bin". When decoding, I read the text and dictionary from the "outfile.bin", the encoded string is decrypted, and then I put it in "infile.txt ". How do I write down the dictionary and the encoded string? First, I write down the size of a line of encoded code, then I write down the line of code itself, which I first supplement to a multiple of 8 so that it is convenient to record and have less memory. I am adding zeros to the right, as this will make it easier to trim this line when reading. Then I write down the size of the dictionary and the dictionary itself. First, I write down the character as a single byte, then I write down the length of the line of code, and then the code itself, which I first add to a multiple of 8 so that it is convenient to write and have less memory. I am adding zeros to the right, as this will make it easier to trim this line when reading.
